# Printing
Printing means writing text to the screen. A traditional first exercise when learning programming is to print "Hello, world!" to the screen. For Python this would look like:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

It is possible to print anything to the screen. For example, you can print the number 10:
```
print(10)
```

# Variables
Variables hold values. You can assign a value to a variable like this:
```
a = 5
```

If you want to check the value of a variable, you can print it out:
```
a = 5
print(a)
```

Why does this print "5" rather than "a"?
